- Learning goals of this module;
1. Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions that operate on primitive data.
2. Be able to read a complete function design and identify its different elements.
3. Be able to evaluate the differnet elements for clarity, simplicity and consistency with each other.
4. Be able to evalute the entire design for how well it solves the given program.

> Steps of the HtDF Design Recipe:

1. Signature, Purpose, and stub.
2. Define examples (unit-tests with +80% coverage)
3. Template and inventory.
4. Code the function body.
5. Test and debug until correct.


* In BSL, we are only allowed to have a pair. To construct a list, we generate a pair with its second element being an another pair, and so on. [Pairs and Lists](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/pairs.html#:~:text=next%20%E2%86%92-,3.8%C2%A0Pairs%20and%20Lists,-A%20pair%20joins)

**You need to understand the lists and pairs in BSL in order to understand the following case study properly.**

* [Example of using HtDF Recipe case study](https://htdp.org/2023-8-14/Book/part_four.html#%28part._sec~3atwo-inputs~3acase1%29:~:text=of%20compound%20data.-,23.1%C2%A0Processing%20Two%20Lists%20Simultaneously%3A%20Case%201,-Consider%20the%20following)

* "Run early, run often" principle helps you to detect any typo or syntax error early, which makes it easy to fix and move on.
